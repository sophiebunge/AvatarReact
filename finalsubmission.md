# Title

Digital Twin

# Description

This website recognizes a persons emotion through a webcam and displays the emotions using the library of DeepFace. Furthermore, the recognized emotion is then send to an Avatar from _ReadyPlayerMe.com_ wich then mimics this emotion. In the center of the Website is an small experiment so users can try to figure out which expressions is showcased on the pictures by mimic it. (it still doesn't tell you right or wrong.) The avatars are fully customable and for an user experiment I would run the project locally and could easly add the costumized avatar.

# Results

An avatar that mimics the captured emotions, which is the MVP I wanted to reach based on my first project plan.

# Discussion of Results

The results are the MVP I was aiming for and that it works is still a surpise for me.

# Next steps, future worl

Would be to come up with a good experiment setup which can actually be tested by users and see if they are influenced by the avatars reactions.
