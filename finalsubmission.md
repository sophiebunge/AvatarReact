### Title

Digital Twin

### Description

This website recognizes a persons emotion through a webcam and displays the emotions using the library of DeepFace. Furthermore, the recognized emotion is then send to an Avatar from _ReadyPlayerMe.com_ wich then mimics this emotion. In the center of the Website is an small experiment so users can try to figure out which expressions is showcased on the pictures by mimic it. (it still doesn't tell you right or wrong.) The avatars are fully customable and for an user experiment I would run the project locally and could easly add the costumized avatar.

### Results

An avatar that mimics the captured emotions, which is the MVP I wanted to reach based on my first project plan.

### Discussion of Results

The results are the MVP I was aiming for and that it works is still a surpise for me.

### Next steps, future worl

Would be to come up with a good experiment setup which can actually be tested by users and see if they are influenced by the avatars reactions.

### Reflections

**Technical Reflections:**
I initially wrote that I wanted to create my project on TouchDesigner to take this oportunity to lear the program, however, TouchDesigner resulted to not work for me. I had issues on creating a workflow to adapt an emotion recognition inside the app. This took my quite some time to figure out, that this won't be the way to go. Nevertheless, I find on creating a React App a good enough learning anyways, and personally satisfactory to gain more knowledge in this.

**MVP and Best-Case Scenario Reflections:**
I reached the MVP, however the best case scenario is still quite a route to go. What still need to be done is to create a good experiment scenario to be tested and a good method to analyse the outcomes.

**What would I do differently?**
Altough, the results are okay-ish in my opinion, and I was hoping to get better final results with a great analysis of the outcomes created form a great and well done experiment, what I somehow did not had in mind is that most of what I am doing, I am also learning. It's not a ordinary project I have done a few times with the same programs and skills, this project requires much more learning and has a lots of "first times" for me. Nevertheless, this is also the reason why I started this study, to learn as much as possible.

**Challenge of your comfort zone?**
Probably everything. This is my second time creating an React App, but pretty much everything else is new to me. I learned how to: handle frontend and backends, create and work with virtual environments, uses ML libraries like DeepFace, intergrate Avatars to a ReactApp and apply MorphTargets to change its facial expressions.

**Reflection of original workplan**
I did not followed the initial work plan,d
